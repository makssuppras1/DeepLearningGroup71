Implementing a Neural Network from Scratch with NumPy: Training, Optimization, and Experiment Tracking with Weights & Biases (WandB)
Objective: The goal of this project is to design and train a fully-connected feedforward neural network (FFN) from scratch using only NumPy, without relying on deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Implement forward and backward propagation, gradient descent optimization, and evaluate the model on small-scale classification datasets — including both tabular and image-based tasks.
Datasets: Two open-source datasets are recommended:
Fashion-MNIST
CIFAR-10
These datasets are small enough for CPU-based NumPy training and sufficiently complex to illustrate overfitting, regularization, and optimizer effects. But if you find any interesting open-source data in Kaggle fell free to use them.
Methodology: Implement a flexible FFNN class with the following configurable hyperparameters:
Num epochs, num_hidden_layers, n_hidden_units, learning rate, optimizer, batch_size, l2_coeff, weights_init, activation, loss etc.
Implementation stages:
Forward pass: matrix multiplications + activation functions
Loss computation: MSE or cross-entropy with L2 regularization
Backward pass: manual derivative calculation and weight updates
Training loop: mini-batch gradient descent
Evaluation: compute accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrices

Experiment Logging with WandB: Each training run will be logged to Weights & Biases, including:
Learning curves (train_loss, val_loss, accuracy, val_acc)
Parameter histograms and gradient norms
Hyperparameter sweeps (random or Bayesian) across architectures and optimizers
Summary reports comparing activation functions and initializations
This project will be supervised by Viswanathan Sankar (viswa@dtu.dk).
